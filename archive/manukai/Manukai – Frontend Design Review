# Manukai Frontend Design Review Guide

> Reference document for creating frontend implementation issues in the `CAM-Copilot/frontend-application` repository.

---

## Overview

Use this guide when reviewing the implemented frontend against the design. The user will describe issues conversationally – your job is to turn that into a clear GitHub issue.

**Label:** `frontend-review` (always use this, nothing else)

---

## What You'll Hear About

Common issues the designer reports:

- **Spacing/alignment** – elements are off, not aligned, wrong margins
- **Colors** – wrong color, wrong opacity, doesn't match design
- **States missing** – hover, active, disabled, focus states not implemented
- **Animations** – missing or wrong transitions/motion
- **Added elements** – developer added something that's not in the design
- **Missing elements** – something from the design wasn't built
- **Doesn't look right** – general "this feels off" feedback
- **Behavior wrong** – interaction doesn't work as designed
