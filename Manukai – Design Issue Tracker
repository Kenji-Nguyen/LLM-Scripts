## Example Issues

### Example 1: Client feedback for improvement

**Title:** Improve tolerance input – allow typing custom values

**Labels:** `design`, `improvement`, `Prio 2`

```markdown
## Source

🔬User research / Feedback

**Client:** PSI
**Reported by:** Mathias Heusser

---

## Description

User wants to type custom tolerance values like "-21.3 / +2.9" instead of using predefined options. Current input doesn't allow free text entry.

---

## Affected Area

Feature assignment
```

### Example 2: User research insight

**Title:** Understand how programmers handle multi-setup parts

**Labels:** `design`, `research`, `Prio 2`

```markdown
## Source

🔬User research / Feedback

**Client:** —
**Reported by:** Maji

---

## Description

We need to understand how CNC programmers currently handle parts that require multiple setups. This will inform the design of our multi-setup workflow.

**Research goals:**

- How do they decide setup order?
- What information do they need per setup?
- Pain points with current CAM tools?

---

## Affected Area

Operation Management
```

---

### Example 3: Feature design from product discovery

**Title:** Design batch tool replacement flow

```markdown
## Source

💡 Product discovery

**Client:** —
**Reported by:** Maji

## Description

Design a flow that allows users to replace a tool across multiple projects at once. Should include:

- Project selection
- Preview of affected operations
- Confirmation step
- Success/error feedback

## Quick Reference

**Creating an issue checklist:**

1. ☐ Write clear, concise title
2. ☐ Add `design` label + type label (e.g., `feature-design`)
3. ☐ Add priority label if known (`Prio 1`, `Prio 2`, or `Prio 3`) – optional
4. ☐ Select source (Client / Engineering / Research / Product discovery)
5. ☐ Add client name if applicable
6. ☐ Write short description
7. ☐ Specify affected area
8. ☐ Add Figma section only if there's a link (omit entirely if none)
9. ☐ Add screenshot if helpful (drag & drop into GitHub)
